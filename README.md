## About Project
Nigeria's public educational system is plagued with periodic strikes. Academic activities are on hold and the impact is felt largely on the students, who in most instances remain idle for the period of the strike or in the long run, they end up spending more years in university because of the constant strikes.

We take a look at Nigeria's Educational Budget Allocation from 1988 to 2022. UNESCO recommends developing countries to allocate 15% of their annual budget to Education. How has Nigeria fared in respect of this? Do they allocate more, less or the exact amount? Let's find out from our analysis. However, let me point out here than the visualization contains data from 2000-2022 to prevent clustering of information in our dashboard.

## Data Collection
Data was collected from articles and the press. 

## Data Wrangling
The data was cleaned with Python. I had to change data type, rename columns, drop irrelevant columns and so on. After data cleaning, I prepared the data and converted to csv files for analysis using SQL

## Data Analysis
The data was analysed with MySQL and prepared for visualization on Tableau

## Data Visualization
After analysis, the data was imported to Tableau for visualization where we created a dashboard displaying a breakdown of Nigeria's Educational Budget Allocation.
